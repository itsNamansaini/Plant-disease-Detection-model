# Plant-disease-Detection-model

Modeling plant disease detection involves using computer programs, especially those that learn from data, to identify and predict plant diseases. This process includes collecting images and data from sensors, cleaning and preparing the data, and then training models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to recognize disease patterns. These trained models are tested for accuracy and then used in real-time systems, such as mobile apps, to help farmers detect diseases quickly. Continuous updates and new data help improve the models over time.
